## Waste your money

### TODO:

1. Add rate up

2. Add dupe gem counter (and maybe upgrading units)

3. Add percentages (i.e. how many are a 3 star, how many a 2 star, how many 1 star.)
  - compare to base: 72% 1 star, 26% 2 star, 2% 3 star if you're doing ten rolls, or 80/18/2 otherwise.
    - perhaps create some way to count the ten rolls and one rolls done to give this baseline?

4. Add good CSS
